      <b>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</b> is used to format the layout of a

    <p>
      CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation,
      including layout, colors, and fonts.[4] This separation can improve
      content accessibility, since the content can be written without concern
      for its presentation; provide more flexibility and control in the
      specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages
      to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css
      file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content;
      and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed
      between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
