        A <b>website</b> ( also written as a <b>web site</b>) is one or more
        <span class="text-blue">web pages</span> and related content that is
        identified by a common <span class="text-blue">domain name</span> and
        published on the last one
        <span class="text-blue">web server.</span> Websites are typically
        dedicated to a particular topic or purpose, such as news, education,
        commerce, entertainment, or home page. Hyperlinking between web pages
        guides the navigation of the site, which often starts with a
        <span class="text-blue">home page</span>. The
        <span class="text-blue">most-visited</span> sites are
        <span class="text-blue">Google</span>,
        <span class="text-blue">YouTube</span>, and
        <span class="text-blue">Facebook</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        All publicly-accessible websites collectively constitute the
        <span class="text-blue">World Wide Web.</span> There are also private
        websites that can only be accessed on a
        <span class="text-blue">private network</span>, sush as a company's
        internal website for its employees.
        <span class="text-blue">Users</span> can be access websites on the rage
        of devices, including <span class="text-blue">desktop</span>,
        <span class="text-blue">laptops</span>,
        <span class="text-blue">tables</span>, and
        <span class="text-blue">smartphones</span>. The
        <span class="text-blue">app</span> used on these devices is called a
        <span class="text-blue">web browser</span>.
